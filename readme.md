## Overview

The Meal Planner is a web-based application designed to help users organize and visualize their weekly meals efficiently. With an intuitive interface and simple navigation, users can view a predefined weekly plan that includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner for each day. The aim is to promote better eating habits, reduce food waste, and streamline grocery planning.

## Rules, Practices and Principles

<!-- Do not Change this -->

1. Always use `AD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename `.php` files if they are pages; always use `index.php` as the filename.
3. Add `.component` to the `.php` files if they are components code; example: `footer.component.php`.
4. Add `.util` to the `.php` files if they are utility codes; example: `account.util.php`.
5. Place Files in their respective folders.
6. Different file naming Cases
   | Naming Case | Type of code         | Example                           |
   | ----------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
   | Pascal      | Utility              | Accoun.util.php                   |
   | Camel       | Components and Pages | index.php or footer.component.php |
8. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
9. Use proper label in your github commits: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor` and `docs`
10. File Structure to follow below.
